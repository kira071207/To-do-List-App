# About
This project helped me understand element manipulation through javascript. It help me understand dynamic designs and animations
as well as suitable UI for users. This project made it much easier for me to add, remove and manipulate many elements rather than using
HTML which would make the process much lengthier.

# Programming languages used:
Javascript, HTML, CSS
